# Octra-Labs

## Introduction
A blockchain network focused on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). It aims to provide secure, private computation environments for developers to build privacy-preserving applications. Octra supports isolated execution environments, smart contract development in languages like OCaml, AST, ReasonML, and C++, and uses an innovative hypergraph data structure for efficient FHE operations.

## Key Features
- Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE): Enables computations on encrypted data without decryption, ensuring privacy for sensitive data in applications like finance and healthcare.
- Hypergraph Architecture: Utilizes hypergraphs for efficient logical operations, enhancing FHE performance by representing complex data relationships.
- Smart Contract Support: Supports smart contract development in OCaml, AST, ReasonML, and C++, offering developers flexibility for privacy-preserving applications.
- Isolated Execution Environments: Provides secure, tamper-proof environments for executing sensitive computations, ensuring data confidentiality.
- Testnet Phase 1 (Launched January 2025): Features over 300 validators across all continents, with 12,723.64 GB RAM and 154,938.36 GB disk space, emphasizing decentralization and scalability.
- Public WASM Sandbox: Demonstrates hypergraph efficiency in FHE, allowing developers to experiment with open-source libraries.
- Proof-of-Useful-Work: Rewards nodes for valuable encrypted computations, replacing traditional mining with consensus-driven computation.
- High Transaction Throughput: Processed 1M+ unencrypted transactions from 318K+ accounts at ~15,000 TPS in testnet, with encrypted transaction functionality in development.
